## 	:star: Features and Stacks
In the development of SavePass, React Native was used with TypeScript in the Expo environment.
To develop this application, I used some resources and concepts:

 - Save your passwords
 - Delete your passwords
 - Clipboard your data

- HooksForms for performance
- AsyncStorage to save data on device
- Expo Clipboard to copy and paste your password
- React Navigation to navigate through the pages
- Use State Hook to manage state on app
- React Native resposive fontsize with RFVALUE for different devices
